## Health Impact Assessment

In the study area (`r states`) over years `r min(years)`-`r max(years)`, the attributable number of deaths to PM2.5 is shown below, aggregated to SA2 by summing over age groups, then averaged across years.

```{r plot-sa2, echo=FALSE}
targets::tar_read(leaflet_an) %>% leaflet::addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron")
```

Table format:

```{r dt-sa2, echo=FALSE}
dat_an <- targets::tar_read(calc_attributable_number)
dat_an <- dat_an[,.(Population = sum(pop_study, na.rm = T),
                    "Expected Deaths" = sum(expected, na.rm = T),
                    "Attributable Deaths" = sum(attributable, na.rm = T),
                    "Mean CF PM2.5 Exposure" = mean(v1, na.rm = T),
                    "Mean baseline PM2.5 Exposure" = mean(x, na.rm = T)),
                 by = .(State = state,  Year = year)]
knitr::kable(dat_an,
             caption = "Attributable number of deaths (PM2.5) by state and year with associated counterfactual delta and  population-weighted exposure for baseline case.")
